## Description
This project was inspired by Chris Deleon's 'Hands-On Intro to Game Programming (v5)' and will be populated with more games as I have time to work through the book. I'll add twists as I am inspired, but I promise no particular innovations as this is a learning project.

Currently the major feature is the GameManager that allows for games to be loaded in a standardized way to make adding future games easier. Additionally I have created a suite of defined UI draw calls and button implementations to speed the creation of future games.

This is a self-driven tutorial sort of project I am working on in my free time.

Enjoy.

# Game List:
